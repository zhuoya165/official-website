            <h2>World Famous Coffee Shop</h2>
                <img src="img/news1.jpg" style="margin-bottom:30px;"/>
                <strong>Royce Coffee House in the United Kingdom
</strong> <p>
Established in London, England in the 17th century, Rosie Café has a weird stipulation "forbidden in women", perhaps the founder Rossi is a Turkish Muslim. The housewives submitted a petition to the mayor, pointing out that her husband had lost energy because of coffee, affecting his wife’s life. Men have claimed that this is a "woman who does not drink coffee" and "dissatisfied with their coffee" in the slaughter, which led to the war between men and women.
 </p><strong>
Italian "Florian Coffee House"
</strong> <p>
It is the oldest coffee shop in Europe. In the 19th century writer Hen James's novel, this was described as: "Let's spend the night on the water tonight! The moonlight in Venice is so beautiful! Otherwise, sit in the Florian Coffee House and order an ice cream." Listen to music and chat with old friends."
 </p> <p><strong>
Austria Demer Coffee Shop</strong>
 </p> <p>
It has been more than 200 years old to make famous coffee and coffee desserts in Europe, and it has been enjoyed by the Austrian royal family for a long time. It is like King Hussein, Queen of England, and Michael in Jordan. Jackson and others were once guests.
 </p> <p>
Although Demel's prices are high, guests who come here are still rarely able to resist the temptation. Although it is called a coffee shop, most tourists still come for the cakes here.

Demir's most famous coffee is coffee with unique fruit wines and coffee brewed from its own roasted coffee beans. Even the Austrian King of the Sacrifice will descend from the palace and sit here to enjoy coffee and coffee snacks. De Meier is so popular, perhaps only here, that Ichii Xiaomin can also be on par with your own.

Left bank cafe</strong>
 <p>
In the 19th century, the Seine River in Paris, France, flowed through the center of Paris. The right bank of the river was the bustling temperament of emerging businesses. The left bank of the river was rich in humanistic thoughts of art. At the time, the left bank of the river had many cafes.
 </p> <p>
The birth of the left bank coffee shop is facilitated by this thirst for literary thought. The convergence of humanistic spirits is not confined to a certain coffee shop, but comes from the whole of the left bank of the Seine. The abundant intensity of thought and art spreads even more along with the left bank. The left bank has become an irreplaceable adjective and represents an adjective of abundant humanistic ideas.
 </p> <p>
Since the establishment of the "Left Bank Cafe" brand by Taiwan's unified enterprises, the entire market has grown from a brand to a product and it has succeeded in occupying a large market share.

</p> <p> The light in the morning is the most beautiful, and the rising sun can be covered with full body. When you enter the Cuatri Café, many small and delicate places are full of 19th century exquisite style. </p>
<p>In summer, Quadry has a signature ice chocolate that is very popular and often in short supply. Apart from the open-air café on the first floor, the hotel is also on the second floor. There is also a magnificently decorated restaurant. The hall is decorated with dazzling crystal lamps. The table is neatly arranged with delicate tableware.
